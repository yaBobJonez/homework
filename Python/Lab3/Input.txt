A half-moon glowed on smooth granite boulders, turning them
silver. The silence was broken only by the ripple of water from the
swift black river and the whisper of trees in the forest beyond.
There was a stirring in the shadows, and from all around lithe
dark shapes crept stealthily over the rocks. Unsheathed claws
glinted in the moonlight. Wary eyes flashed like amber. And then,
as if on a silent signal, the creatures leaped at each other, and
suddenly the rocks were alive with wrestling, screeching cats.
