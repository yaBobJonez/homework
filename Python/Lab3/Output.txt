A HALF-MOON GLOWED on SMOOTH GRANITE BOULDERS, TURNING THEM SILVER. THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN ONLY by THE RIPPLE of WATER FROM THE SWIFT BLACK RIVER AND THE WHISPER of TREES in THE FOREST BEYOND. THERE WAS a STIRRING in THE SHADOWS, AND FROM ALL AROUND LITHE DARK SHAPES CREPT STEALTHILY OVER THE ROCKS. UNSHEATHED CLAWS GLINTED in THE MOONLIGHT. WARY EYES FLASHED LIKE AMBER. AND THEN, as if on a SILENT SIGNAL, THE CREATURES LEAPED at EACH OTHER, AND SUDDENLY THE ROCKS WERE ALIVE WITH WRESTLING, SCREECHING CATS.
